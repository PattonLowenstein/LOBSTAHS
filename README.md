# LOBSTAHS

**June 20, 2016:** A citable manuscript describing LOBSTAHS has been accepted for publication in *Analytical Chemistry.* Details (and DOI) are below.

This is the repository for the R package **LOBSTAHS**, developed in the Van Mooy Lab at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. LOBSTAHS (Lipid and Oxylipin Biomarker Screening Through Adduct Hierarchy Sequences) is a multifunction package for screening, annotation, and putative identification of mass spectral features in large, HPLC-MS lipid datasets. Installation instructions and some general information about LOBSTAHS are given below.

A [comprehensive vignette](https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics/LOBSTAHS/blob/master/vignettes/LOBSTAHS.Rmd) contains detailed, step-by-step user instructions and examples of package functions illustrated with a model dataset. 

Latest package updates (with change notes) are published to the [releases](https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics/LOBSTAHS/releases) page.

<h4>LOBSTAHS dataset preparation in xcms and CAMERA</h4> 
(See [this comprehensive vignette](https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics/LOBSTAHS/blob/master/vignettes/LOBSTAHS.Rmd) for a much more detailed treatment of package functionality.) HPLC-MS data must be assembled into a CAMERA xsAnnotate object prior to analysis with LOBSTAHS. Scripts are provided in the [Van Mooy Lab Lipidomics Toolbox](https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics/LipidomicsToolbox) for preparing HPLC-ESI-MS data from an Orbitrap Exactive mass spectrometer in [**xcms**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CAMERA.html) and then [**CAMERA**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CAMERA.html). Or, the user can use his/her own implementation of xcms and CAMERA. We have successfully used the [IPO](https://github.com/glibiseller/IPO/) package to optimize xcms and CAMERA settings for a variety of datasets.

<h4>In silico database generation</h4> 
*In silico* data for a wide range of lipids, oxidized lipids, and oxylipins are generated from user-supplied structural criteria using the database generation function `generateLOBdbase()`. The function pairs these *in silico* data with empirically-determined adduct ion abundance rankings for the major lipid classes. Users can generate their own matrices of structural property ranges to be considered during a `generateLOBdbase()` simulation using the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet templates provided in https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics/LOBSTAHS/tree/master/data-raw. (Users should generate .csv files from this Excel spreadsheets.) Ranges of values can be specified for: 

   * oxidation state,
   * total acyl carbon chain length, and
   * degree of acyl carbon chain unsaturation (i.e., number of double bonds)

Alternatively, users may load the LOBSTAHS default databases. These contain entries for a wide range of intact polar diacylglycerols (IP-DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs), free fatty acids (FFA), and common photosynthetic pigments. These default databases contain data on 13,578 and 11,073 unique compounds that can be identifed in positive and negative ionization mode data, respectively. 

<h4>Identification, screening, and annotation using orthogonal criteria</h4> 
The function `doLOBscreen()` is then used to assign putative compound identities from these *in silico* databases to peakgroups in any high-mass accuracy dataset that has been processed using [xcms](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CAMERA.html) and [CAMERA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CAMERA.html). doLOBscreen then applies a series of user-selected orthogonal screening criteria based on

   * adduct ion formation patterns,
   * chromatographic retention time, and
   * fatty acid chain length (i.e., even-over-odd preference in eukaryotes for total number of acyl carbon atoms),

to evaluate and assign confidence scores to this list of preliminary assignments. During the screening routine, `doLOBscreen()` rejects assignments that do not meet the specified criteria, identifies potential isomers and isobars, and assigns a variety of annotation codes to assist the user in evaluating the accuracy of each assignment. Results can be extracted and/or exported to file using the `getLOBpeaklist()` function.

<h4>Example dataset</h4> 
The package [**PtH2O2lipids**](https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics/PtH2O2lipids/) contains a example dataset with which users can familiarize themselves with LOBSTAHS. The dataset contains both a CAMERA "xsAnnotate" object and the LOBSTAHS "LOBSet" generated from it using `doLOBscreen()`. Processing of the dataset is described in: Collins, J.R., B.R. Edwards, H.F. Fredricks, and B.A.S. Van Mooy. 2016. "LOBSTAHS: An adduct-based lipidomics strategy for discovery and identification of oxidative stress biomarkers." In review for *Analytical Chemistry*.

<h4>Code used to generate figures in Collins et al. LOBSTAHS manuscript</h4>
Scripts used to generate the figures and many of the tables in the above referenced manuscript can be found at https://github.com/jamesrco/LipidomicsDataViz/tree/master/LOBSTAHS

LOBSTAHS is maintained by [Jamie Collins](https://jamesrco.github.io) and replaces the "old" Van Mooy Lab lipidomics pipeline, which has been moved to https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics/old_pipeline.
